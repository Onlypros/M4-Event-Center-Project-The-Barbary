## 📝 Notes

- This project was created for learning and portfolio purposes.
- No backend functionality is included — the "Contact Us" form does not send data (form action is placeholder `#`).
- All images are optimized and lazy-loaded where appropriate for performance.
- Minified global CSS (`site.min.css`) is used to reduce HTTP requests and improve load times.
- The site was developed, tested, and optimized with the assistance of AI (ChatGPT) as part of the CustomGPT I built as a Hybrid Python Bootcamp teaching assistant.
- The site has been tested on:
    - Chrome
