## Reflection

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice building a complete multi-page responsive website from scratch using HTML and CSS. Throughout the process, I gained valuable experience with semantic HTML, responsive layout techniques (flexbox, grid, media queries), and CSS optimization (minification).

Additionally, the site was developed, tested, and optimized with the assistance of AI (ChatGPT) as part of the CustomGPT I built as a Hybrid Python Bootcamp teaching assistant. This collaborative approach greatly improved both my learning process and the final product.
